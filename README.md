Project descriptionA 48 hours Hackathon group project.

## The Project Idea
The theme of our project was randomly picked from a selection of songs. The song we ended up with was 
"The Show Must Go On" by Queen. The song it's about life. You could Replace the word 'show' with 'life', and the meaning 
that there are hard times in life but we should carry on and still aim high. So in the actual context of COVID-19 and already 
cancelled events and concert, there is a need to offer people a solution to this problem, the way our app accomplish this is 
by engaging with the entertainment industry and people to make plans that would involve rescheduling, exchange, buy or sell 
tickets of affected events.

##The Development
We divided the project into sprints of about 8 hours of interval. We started by reading the lyrics of the song and watching 
the videoclip. We then brainstormed the basic idea for the project. When the group was satisfied with the idea, we set out to 
build the structure of the project and map the database.
Afterwards, we split the group into two parts: backend and frontend. The frontend group began working on the project 
design using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap technologies. In terms of backend, we started structuring the project by creating 
packages and their respective classes, and started implementing their methods, with the intention of ensuring fluid database
communication. Persistence tests were made using Postman software. Finally, we joined backend and frontend development together.
